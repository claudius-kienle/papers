    caption: QueryCAD answers questions about CAD models with precise measurements.
abstract: |
    CAD models are widely used in industry and are essential for robotic automation processes. However, these models are rarely considered in novel AI-based approaches, such as the automatic synthesis of robot programs, as there are no readily available methods that would allow CAD models to be incorporated for the analysis, interpretation or extraction of information.

    To address these limitations, we propose QueryCAD, the first system designed for CAD Question Answering, enabling the extraction of precise information from CAD models using natural language queries. QueryCAD incorporates CAD-Seg, an open-vocabulary instance segmentation model we developed to identify and select specific parts of the CAD model based on part descriptions. We further propose a CAD Question-Answering Benchmark to evaluate QueryCAD and establish a foundation for future research.

    Lastly, we integrate QueryCAD within an automatic robot program synthesis framework, validating its ability to enhance deep-learning solutions for robotics by enabling them to process CAD models. However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments.

All measurements are provided in meters. Your code should also work in meters.
In your response, always include all steps and don't skip steps already given in previous messages
You can assume width is x, depth is y and height is z axis.
Ensure that diameters and radius are respected correctly.
Ensure to multiply the `half_extents` by 2 to to get the height, width or depth of a element.
Save your result in a variable called `solution`.

You can use following python classes and functions in you code. The implementation is hidden.
Do not use any other custom functions.

                            Distribution of dataset questions. Every question is composed of a part it asks about
                            (inner circle), a property to retrieve (middle circle) and optionally one or multiple
                            sides the part must be visible from (outer circle). Some questions enforce additional
                            filtering based on the part properties, like retrieving only parts with a radius of 5
                            mm.
